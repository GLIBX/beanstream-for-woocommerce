This plugin aims to show anyone that they can use Beanstream to take credit card payments in their WooCommerce store without having to write a single line of code. All you have to do is copy Merchand id and API pass key to a settings page and you're done.\r\n\r\n### Get Credentials from Beanstream\r\nYou need to have an active gateway account with Beanstream.\r\n* Login to your [Beanstream](https://www.beanstream.com/admin/sDefault.asp)\r\n* In the top right corner of your account dashboard will be a “Welcome” message.  Under this is a field labeled “Merchant ID” and Find 'API access passcode' inside the Order settings page\r\n* Copy these two values to your Woo Commerce Beanstream settings page and “Save Settings”\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIf you'd like to contribute, feel free to tackle a feature or fix a bug and when you're ready, send a pull request.
